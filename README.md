## What is ddev-phpmyadmin?

This add-on provides a phpMyAdmin service for [DDEV](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/). 

In DDEV v1.22+ PhpMyAdmin will not be provided by default, but can be added with this add-on:

`ddev get ddev/ddev-phpmyadmin`

You can run PhpMyAdmin easily with the command `ddev phpmyadmin` after installing this add-on.
